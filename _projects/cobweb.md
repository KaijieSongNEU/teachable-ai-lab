Cobweb is a clustering model which supports incremental concept learning from fewer examples. The model learns both structure and parameters where the structural expansion is dynamic. It uses multimodal approach which is human like. Future scope is to optimize exisitng model, integrate concept learning with skill learning and organize skills with cobweb.
