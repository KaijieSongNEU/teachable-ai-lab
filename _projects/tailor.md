Human performance optimization (HPO) is centered around designing tools and 
interventions that increase human performance. Typically, A/B experiments are
used to evaluate alternative HPO interventions to determine which yield the
best performance. Unfortunately, A/B experiments are time consuming and costly
to run. Further, each new intervention requires an additional A/B experiment
to evaluate it, which means that it is often feasible to only evaluate a few
intervetions. To overcome these issues, we exploring the use of _computational
models of humans_---or computer models that receive the same stimuli as human
A/B experiment participants and then make the same decisions they do---to
simulate A/B experiments and support reasoning about about hypothetical and
counterfactual HPO interventions. Additionally, we are also exploring how 
data about specific individuals can be leveraged to create _tuned computational
models_ that better approximate and predict the behavior of specific individuals
they were tuned to.

Here is an example of a prediction form our model for a fractions tutoring system
HPO intervention (see [MacLellan, Stowers, and Brady, 2020][ACS 2020] for more
