### Who we are

The Teachable AI Lab (or TAIL for short) is an interdisciplinary research group at
[Georgia Institute of Technology][gt home]'s [School of Interactive Computing][ic
home]. Our mission is to better understand how people teach and learn and to
build machines that can teach and learn like people do. We engage in both
_use-inspired_ and _fundamental_ research to achieve this mission.

### What we do

Our research focuses primarily on three thrust areas: (1) **Teachable
Systems**, (2) **Human-Like AI/ML Models**, and (3) **Computational Models of
Human Learning and Decision Making**. As highlighted in the following figure,
these thrust areas are synergistic and support one another.

![Three Teachable AI Lab research thrusts and how they relate to one
another][research thrusts]

Within each thrust, we aim to address the following questions:

- **Teachable Systems**: How do we build systems people can teach and interact
  with, like they would another human, while still taking advantage of key
  non-human features of AI/ML systems?

- **Human-like AI/ML**: How do we develop cognitive systems that can learn like
  humans (incrementally, with few examples, etc.) and that produce human
  relatable/explainable/understandable outputs? The emphasis will be on both
  developing distinct AI and ML components as well as on putting these
  components together to create integrated systems.

- **Computational Models of Human Learning and Decision Making**: How can we
  leverage human data to guide human-like computational model design? How can
  we leverage these human-like models to better understand human decision
  making and learning?

[publications](publications.html).

### Our values

Our lab is committed to developing a positive lab culture where individuals
are supported and invested in the lab mission. To support this commitment,
we have created a [lab manual][lab manual] that describes our lab, the cultural
values we aspire to, and expectations for lab members.
