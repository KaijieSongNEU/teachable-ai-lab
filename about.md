### Who we are

The Teachable AI Lab (or TAIL for short) is an interdisciplinary research group
at [Georgia Institute of Technology][gt home]'s [School of Interactive
Computing][ic home] (find us at TSRB 230B). Our mission is to better understand how
people teach and learn and to build machines that can teach and learn like
people do. We engage in both _use-inspired_ and _fundamental_ research to
achieve this mission.

### What we do

Our research focuses primarily on three thrust areas: (1) **Teachable
Systems**, (2) **Human-Like AI/ML Models**, and (3) **Computational Models of
Human Learning and Decision Making**. As highlighted in the following figure,
these thrust areas are synergistic and support one another.

![Three Teachable AI Lab research thrusts and how they relate to one
another][research thrusts]

Within each thrust, we aim to address the following questions:

- **Teachable Systems**: How do we build systems people can teach and interact
  with, like they would another human, while still taking advantage of key
  non-human features of AI/ML systems?

- **Human-like AI/ML**: How do we develop cognitive systems that can learn like
  humans (incrementally, with few examples, etc.) and that produce human
  relatable/explainable/understandable outputs? The emphasis will be on both
  developing distinct AI and ML components as well as on putting these
  components together to create integrated systems. See this
  [page](https://humanlikelearning.com) for more info on our efforts to build a
  community and research program around this topic.

- **Computational Models of Human Learning and Decision Making**: How can we
  leverage human data to guide human-like computational model design? How can
  we leverage these human-like models to better understand human decision
  making and learning?

For more information about our lab, see our [lab vision blog post][lab vision
blogpost]  and our pages on [research](research.html) and
[publications](publications.html).

### Our values

Our lab is committed to developing a positive lab culture where individuals
are supported and invested in the lab mission. To support this commitment,
we have created a [lab manual][lab manual] that describes our lab, the cultural
values we aspire to, and expectations for lab members.

### Interested in getting involved?

If you are a Georgia Tech student, then your first entry point to getting
involved with the lab will likely be an independent study. Please review our
[independent study guide][independent study guide] to see if this is a good
option for you. Note, all students interested in conducting an independent
study should follow the steps in this guide before reaching out via email.

If you are not a Georgia Tech student or are looking for something other than
an independent study, then please fill out [this application][tail-application]
to apply to work in the lab directly. We will get notified when you submit your
application and will follow up about available opportunities. If you do follow
up via email, then please reference your application in the email.
